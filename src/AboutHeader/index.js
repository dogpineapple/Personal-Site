        <h1>About <span role="img" aria-label="sunflower">ðŸŒ»</span> </h1>
        <p>My name is Dingren Liang, but please call me <span className="AboutHeader-name">Diana</span>!</p>
        <p>I studied Full-stack Web Development at <span className="AboutHeader-rithm">Rithm School</span>, based in San Francisco (Aug 2020/Cohort R16).</p>
        <p>Before I started my journey with web development, I graduated from UC Davis with a B.S. in Global Disease Biology with a concentration. At UC Davis, I was a research intern at a grape pathology lab in UC Davis, where I was introduced to R for data analysis.
        Through R, I began to consider programming more seriously and it gave me an idea to take an Introduction to C Programming in my last year of college. The sense of achievement of being able to solve a difficult problem and being able to see how developing applications 
        can create so much impact and fun would become the reason why I love programming.</p>
        <p>Other than code, I enjoy playing video games, drawing, and watching anime! Some of my favorite games are League of Legends, MapleStory, and Dance Dance Revolution.</p>
